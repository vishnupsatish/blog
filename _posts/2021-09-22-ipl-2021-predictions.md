## Trends

1. The depth of talent that India has is far greater than any other country, due to resources available and population. The depth of India's top-order batsmen far exceeds any other role. This is anecdotally evidenced by seemingly unknown Indian top-order batsmen playing well against (and sometimes dominating) international-quality bowlers. Examples include Rahul Tripathi, Devdutt Padikkal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and more recently, Venkatesh Iyer.


## Predictions

1. Ruturaj Gaikwad will have a more successful IPL career than Devdutt Padikkal.
    - Gaikwad seems to be better at handling pressure than Padikkal. This is evidenced by Gaikwad's innings against MI on 09-19-2021, where he scored 88* (58), when at one point, CSK were 7-3. Padikkal has also had repeated failures when RCB were at precarious positions. This is why I believe Gaikwad will have a more successful career than Devdutt Padikkal, unless Padikkal learns to build an innings under immense pressure.
