Problem type: Dynamic programming

This problems asks to implement a program that outputs the longest strictly (i.e. can't be equal) increasing path in an N x N matrix consisting of integers.


## Solution

This problem can be solved by using top-down dynamic programming. The idea is to use recursion (dividing a problem into sub-problems) with memoization (storing, then re-using calculated value for the sub-problems).

> Note that DP stands for dynamic programming.

We then have to define a DP state (DP array/table representation) and a DP transition (how a problem relates to its sub-problems).

In this problem, the DP state is as follows.

Let `dp[i][j]` represent the longest strictly increasing path in the matrix that begins at `matrix[i][j]`. In this situation, `dp` is a two-dimensional array.

> `matrix[i][j]` represents the value at row `i` and column `j` in the matrix given in the input.

A base case in dynamic programming represents specific DP states that can be pre-calculated without the input or any sub-problems having an impact.

In this case, the base case is as follows.

`dp[i][j]` = 0 if `matrix[i][j]` has no neighbours that are strictly greater than itself.

> There are four neighbours to any value `matrix[i][j]` that is not in the corner, which are `matrix[i + 1][j]`, `matrix[i - 1][j]`, `matrix[i][j + 1]`, and `matrix[i][j - 1]`.

Now, let's think of how we can relate the DP state to other sub-problems. We know that a path must be strictly increasing, so we can only consider neighbours of `matrix[i][j]` if they are greater than `matrix[i][j]`.

Once we determine which neighbours are valid, we have to determine which neighbour to choose as part of the longest path. This is where we can use recursion. Our DP transition is as follows.

`dp[i][j]` = maximum `dp` value of all valid neighbours + 1

There is also one more case we have to handle, which is if `dp[i][j]` does not have four neighbours that we can fix by one-indexing the `matrix` and `dp` arrays and checking whether the neighbours have a value that is not equal to 0.

Now that we have determined our DP state, base case, and transition, we can write the code.
