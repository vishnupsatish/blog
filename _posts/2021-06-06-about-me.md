Hi there, I am Vishnu! I am a high school student who enjoys problem-solving and making an impact through programming.

I have been doing programming for about 2 years now. I started doing full-stack development using Flask around a year ago, and I've recently gotten into competitive programming. 

In this blog, I'll be exploring various topics relating to programming, such as full-stack development and competitive programming. Do note that I'm a competitive programming beginner and many of the posts I will write about it will mostly be to remember problem-solving techniques of interesting problems. I tend to forget how I solved problems, so to avoid forgetting, I'll be writing the idea of the problem as a post. I'll also mostly be solving 7-10 pointers on DMOJ (and the occasional 12-15 pointers).

I also mostly practice on DMOJ. My account is available here:  <a href="https://dmoj.ca/user/vishnus"><img src="https://mosesxu.ca/badges/dmoj/vishnus.svg"></a>
