Problem type: Graph theory

This problem asks us to implement a program that outputs the number of edges in the minimum spanning tree of a weighted, undirected graph. Though we are not given the weights of each edge, we are given that "an edge that shows up earlier in the input has a strictly less weight than an edge that shows up later in the input". If there is no minimum spanning tree (i.e. the graph is not connected) we output "Disconnected Graph".

## Solution

What is a minimum spanning tree? A minimun spanning tree, in a connected, undirected, weighted graph, is the series of edges that connect the enitre graph, while using minimum total edge weight (sum of all weights of the edges visited by the MST).

Below is an example of a minimum spanning tree of a graph.
